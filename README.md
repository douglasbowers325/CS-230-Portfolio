# CS-230-Portfolio

  The client, The Gaming Room, sought to create an application that would incorporate a web application that would allow different teams to input their answers according various images that were displayed.
While originally only on Android, the client wished to expand to a web application that would be more accessible to a wider range of people. In development, the client wished to base their game off of the 1980s game: 
Win, Lose, or Draw. The client also expressed their wants to stay within their budget. For the requirements, I believe this is where the understanding of how the development would take shape. These requirements
helped provide what exactly the client was looking to accomplish with their application, and what needed to be done with development. While edits could still be made, I believe that the overall concept here is laid out
in a coherent manner for the client to review. 

  When interpretting the user's needs, I would ask myself not only as a developer, but as a user, how would I react to this feature being implemented in a certain way. I believe that it is important to not only think 
  of development from your end, but also the users because if it is something that would be disregarded in terms of the user's needs, then you need to take a step back and rethink things. I have to think the user's experience
  and also the client's wants. Both of these should allign with my development and interpretation of what I can offer to the client in terms of overall user experience. I have to keep things simple, accessible, and easy to use
  so that traffic will not decrease due to maintainence. In designing the software, I have to keep in mind proper storage and memmory efficiency. This software should be created with the least amount of resources in order to lessen the risk
  of issues that could arrise. In the future, I would use pseudocode to help express my thoughts and visualize my plans when creating similar software. Extensive testing and debugging would also be extremely helpful when developing software such as this
  to mitigate any issues that may occur.
